# Speech-to-text-Project


### 
In my project on Applied NLP, I ventured into creating a sophisticated Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system using Facebook's cutting-edge Wav2Vec2 Deep Learning Model. This groundbreaking model, coupled with Hugging Face Transformers Pipeline dedicated to audio-to-text conversion, empowered me to achieve live, real-time transcription of spoken language.

To make this technology accessible and user-friendly, I integrated these capabilities into a Python-based web application using Gradio. The result was an intuitive interface that allowed users to experience seamless, accurate, and instant speech recognitionâ€”transforming spoken words into text in real-time, fostering practical and efficient communication.
